# TrustForge

**TrustForge** is an advanced cryptographic identity monitoring and auditing system designed to enhance security and transparency. This document outlines the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) design using software components and a kernel module, as well as the vision for a more advanced, tamper-proof hardware design.

## MVP: Software-Based Solution

### 1.1 Browser Plugin

**Purpose**: Capture and monitor cryptographic identities related to web interactions.

**Functionality**:
- **Key and Certificate Extraction**: Extract cryptographic keys and certificates from web traffic or interactions within the browser.
- **Data Anonymization**: Anonymize captured data to protect sensitive information.
- **Reporting and Alerts**: Provide alerts for any detected anomalies or potential issues.

**Implementation**:
- Develop browser extensions for popular browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Use APIs to access and analyze cryptographic material used in web sessions.

### 1.2 Software Component

**Purpose**: Monitor and analyze network traffic at the operating system level.

**Functionality**:
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Analyze network traffic for cryptographic identities and potential tampering.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate and anonymize the captured data.
- **Local Reporting**: Generate local reports and alerts based on the analysis.

**Implementation**:
- Develop a desktop application or service that runs in the background.
- Utilize network monitoring libraries and tools to capture and analyze traffic.

### 1.3 Kernel Module (Optional)

**Purpose**: Enhance monitoring capabilities at the network stack level.

**Functionality**:
- **Packet Inspection**: Inspect network packets for cryptographic identities and integrity.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detect anomalies or signs of tampering at the kernel level.

**Implementation**:
- Develop a kernel module that integrates with the network stack.
- Implement hooks for monitoring network traffic and processing packets.

## Long-Term: Tamper-Proof Hardware Design

### 2.1 Hardware Platform

**Purpose**: Provide a tamper-proof, multi-layered hardware firewall system with abstract data processing capabilities.

**Functionality**:
- **Modular Interfaces**: Support the insertion and integration of multiple hardware firewall devices.
- **Data Processing**: Abstractly process data rather than acting as a traditional network device.
- **Tamper Resistance**: Incorporate features to detect and respond to physical tampering.

### 2.2 Design Components

- **Tamper-Proof Enclosure**: Design a secure, tamper-evident enclosure to protect internal components.
- **Modular Slots**: Include slots for hardware firewall modules that can be added or replaced as needed.
- **Data Processing Unit**: Implement a central processing unit that handles data abstractly, integrating with the firewall modules.

### 2.3 Data Processing and Security

- **Abstract Data Handling**: Develop a framework for processing data abstractly, enabling flexible and layered security configurations.
- **Hardware Interfaces**: Design interfaces for communication between the central processing unit and the firewall modules.
- **Secure Boot and Firmware**: Ensure that the device boots securely and that firmware updates are protected against tampering.

### 2.4 Integration and Deployment

- **Installation**: Integrate the device between the internet connection and the router/firewall.
- **Configuration**: Configure the device for data processing and firewall module integration.
- **Maintenance**: Provide ongoing support and updates to ensure the device remains secure and functional.

## Conclusion

The **TrustForge** project aims to provide robust security and monitoring capabilities through both software and hardware solutions. The MVP design focuses on software components for immediate deployment, while the long-term vision includes a sophisticated hardware platform for enhanced security and data processing.
